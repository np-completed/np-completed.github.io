# Github Pages Private Source Code

Github pages are great, it provides a free static page hosting, but the only caveat is the repository has to be public repository. And, if you want to keep your source private, you will have to opt for premium plans to host pages from private repository.

Here is what I have done, github allows unlimited private repositories, so I created a new private repo where I kept my source code and another repo where my site is hosted.
